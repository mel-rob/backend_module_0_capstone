## Day 2 Questions

### 1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
`["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`
### 2. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
`animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`
### 3. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
`animals[1]`
### 4. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
`animals.push("lion")` or `animals << "lion"`
### 5. Name and describe two additional array methods.
`pop` drops the last element from an array and returns it. `reverse_each` iterates over every element in the array in reverse order.
### 6. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
Boolean values are used in logic statements to say if something is considered true or false. They can be used to make decisions in programming, as they are often used in conditional statements. In Ruby, there is no Boolean class, but there are boolean objects.
### 7. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
`2 == 25` false
### 8. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
